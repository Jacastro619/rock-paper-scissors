## Description 

[Visit the Deployed Site]()

For this mini-project, myself and two collaborators were tasked with creating a JavaScript file from scratch to implement a rock, paper, scissors game using prompts, confirms, and alerts. When the page initially loads up, it will ask the user to type in 'r', 's', or 'p'. These correspond to Rock, Paper, and Scissors. The computer will also randomly select 'r', 's', or 'p'. Both responses will be evaluated, and the user will win or lose according to the standard rules of the popular game Rock, Paper, Scissors. Statistics of wins, losses, or ties will be tracked until the user decides to no longer play.
